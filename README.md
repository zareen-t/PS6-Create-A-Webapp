### Zareen Tasnim's First Web App
#### User Documentation

For this project I used the Orange Trees Growth in California data set which consisted of the variables trees, age, and circumference. 

My first page shows a random sample of data points with the variables of Tree, Age, Circumference, and Factor. The plot page shows a graph where you can select any color for the plots and you can pick an age range to view. The statement and plot adjust as selections are made. You can also view labels for the trees. My third page contains a table which calculates the average circumference for each age. There is an obvious positive correlation between the two since as the tree ages the circumference increases. You are able to select a specific age to view the average of that tree alone and the statement at the bottom updates correspondingly.
